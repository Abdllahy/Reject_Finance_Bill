# GenData Capstone Project Proposal Template

### Project Title: Impact of AI on Digital Media

### Project Summary
This project leverages a dataset exploring the rise of AI-generated content across industries such as journalism, social media, entertainment, and marketing. Using Excel, SQL, and Tableau, the project aims to uncover insights about public sentiment, engagement metrics, economic impacts, and evolving regulatory trends.

The findings will be useful for data analysts, content strategists, and policy makers interested in tracking the growth and consequences of AI-generated media. Through structured analysis and visualization, the project will highlight emerging patterns and potential areas for further research.

## Program Design
Modular design separating:

   - Data input & preprocessing

   - Analysis logic (SQL)

   - Visualization layer (Tableau)

- Use clear naming conventions for datasets, queries, and dashboard elements

- Ensure scalability by creating reusable SQL views and Excel templates


## Potential Challenges
Data Quality: Incomplete or misaligned data from various sources

Integration Issues: Ensuring Excel, SQL, and Tableau work seamlessly

Subjectivity in Sentiment Analysis: May need qualitative validation

Scalability: Handling large-scale datasets efficiently

## Future Improvements
- Future Improvements
Integrate real-time data feeds from social platforms or APIs

Add a sentiment analysis model to classify new AI-generated content

Include geographic visualizations to see regional variations

Develop a mobile-friendly version of the dashboard using Tableau Public

## Project Questions
How has the volume of AI-generated content evolved over the past 5 years?

Which industries are using AI-generated content the most (e.g., journalism, marketing, entertainment)?

What is the growth rate of AI-generated media content adoption per sector?

What is the general sentiment (positive, neutral, negative) towards AI-generated content on platforms like Twitter, Reddit, etc.?

How does sentiment vary across different industries?

Do AI-generated articles/videos/posts get more or less engagement (likes, shares, comments) than human-generated ones?

Which platforms have the highest interaction rates with AI-generated content?

What are the revenue trends associated with AI-generated content?

How have content creation costs changed with AI adoption?

Is there a correlation between AI content use and advertising revenue growth?

Which countries are leading in AI-generated content creation?

What demographics (age, gender, region) interact the most with AI-generated content?

What are the key regulatory concerns or reported incidents related to AI-generated content (e.g., misinformation, deepfakes)?
